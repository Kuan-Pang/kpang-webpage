I am in my final year of undergrad study, doing {Computer Science, Bioinformatics, and Statistics} @ ![](/assets/img/logo/Utoronto_coa.svg.png){: width="16" } [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). 

Currently, I am a student researcher at ![](/assets/img/logo/vector_logo.png){: width="16" } [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) . I am broadly interested in building computational methods for biomedical applications, and AI4Science in general.

My research work involves multi-modal alignment for spatial transcriptomics and H&E histology images, self-supervised subcellular segmentation for volume electron microscopy(vEM) and generative foundation models for single-cell genomics.
